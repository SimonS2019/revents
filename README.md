# Build an App with React, Redux, and Firestore from Scratch

This project is a web application created by following Neil Cummings' course on Udemy, titled **"Build an App with React, Redux, and Firestore from Scratch."** The purpose of this project is to learn how to implement modern web development technologies like Firebase, React, and Redux.

## Project Overview

This project is **not original content** but follows the step-by-step guidance of the instructor. It is intended to serve as a foundation for learning the implementation of Firebase with React and Redux.

## Demo

## Features

- **Event Management**: Users can create, manage, and participate in events.
- **Firebase Integration**: The application uses Firebase for real-time data storage and authentication.
- **Redux for State Management**: Redux is used to manage global state throughout the app.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, Redux
- **Backend**: Firebase Firestore
- **Hosting**: Firebase Hosting

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

    ```

3. **Install dependencies**:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Usage

To start the development server:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

## Deployment

To deploy the application to Firebase, follow these steps:

1. **Build the project**:

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

    This will create an optimized production build in the `build` folder.

2. **Login to Firebase**:

    ```bash
    firebase login
    ```

    Ensure you have a Firebase account and the Firebase CLI installed.

3. **Deploy to Firebase**:

    ```bash
    firebase deploy
    ```

Your web app should now be live on Firebase Hosting!
