# Build an App with React, Redux, and Firestore from Scratch

This project is a web application created by following the instructions from Neil Cummings' course on Udemy, titled **"Build an App with React, Redux, and Firestore from Scratch."** The purpose of this project is to learn how to implement modern web development technologies like Firebase, React, and Redux.

## Project Overview

This project is **not original content** but follows the step-by-step guidance of the instructor. It is intended to serve as a foundation for learning the implementation of Firebase with React and Redux.

In the future, I plan to use this knowledge to build my own original applications with Firebase and Angular.
